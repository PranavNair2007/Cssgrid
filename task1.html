        <h3>Task 1 Question And Aanswer</h3>
        <div id="1">
            <h2>1. What is the difference between a normal div and a grid container?</h2>
            <p>Div is just a text wrapper which can be later modified by in the CSS, it has no special function on its own rather than allowing the developer to modify the div tags.</p>
            <p>Whereas, Grid is a grid container is an element with its display property set to grid, helping 2D layout capabilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="2">
            <h2>2. Why does the layout look the same even after applying Grid?</h2>
            <p>
            The layout looks the same because setting display: grid alone does not force a visual change.
            If no rows, columns, or gaps are defined, the browser places elements in a default flow that closely
            resembles normal block layout.

        <div id="3">
            <h2>3. Are grid items created automatically?</h2>
            <p>
            Yes, grid items are created automatically. Every direct child element of a grid container becomes
            a grid item without any additional configuration.
            </p>

        <div id="4">
            <h2>4. Can Grid work without rows or columns?</h2>
            <p>
            Grid can work without explicitly defining rows or columns because the browser auto-generates them.
            However, without defined tracks, Grid behaves very similarly to a normal layout and its advantages
            are not clearly visible.

        <div id="5">
            <h2>5. What do you think Grid needs to show visible changes?</h2>
            <p>
            Grid needs explicitly defined rows, columns, or spacing to show visible changes. Properties like
            <code>grid-template-columns</code>, <code>grid-template-rows</code>, and <code>gap</code> provide
            structure and make the grid layout visually distinct.
